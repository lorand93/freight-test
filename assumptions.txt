Key Simplifications Made:
No Database: Assumes all data can be passed through workflow parameters
No User Management: Assumes single customer scenario for demo
No Complex Routing: Assumes simple point-to-point or waypoint routing
No Time Zones: Assumes single time zone operation
No Internationalization: Assumes English-only notifications
No Complex Business Rules: Assumes simple threshold-based logic

Service Integration:
Mock implementations are sufficient for demonstration

Traffic Data Structure:
  - Assumes delay can be expressed in simple minutes
  - Traffic conditions fit into predefined categories
  - Single delay value per route
API integrations:
    - Google maps API: real-time traffic details are available
    - Mocked API integrations for demonstration purposes only
    - Simple prompt engineering is sufficient
    - AI-generated messages do not require content filtering
    - Notifications: No complex templating or personalization needed

Assuming that we're not sending the same notification to multiple users.
Assuming that we're not doing optimizations for calling the APIs.
Assuming that we're not feeding delay reasons to the AI.
Assuming that no monitoring and alerting for this demo.

What happens when google API doesn't return traffic data?
- we could use cached traffic data
- we could use historical traffic data
- we should have a manual triggering mechanism to handle situations where the delay is communicated directly by the company
